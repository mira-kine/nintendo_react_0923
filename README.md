# HOW TO RUN:

1. npm i to install all necessary packages (React)
2. npm start to start browser on localhost:3000

# INITIAL ASSUMPTIONS:

- I used pure React from create-react-app + CSS. Used Typescript as well per job description.
- Since there was no data transfers or user events specified, I assumed none.
- There may be themes and styles set already but I will use modular CSS and manually input viewpoints for now.
- Added light mobile responsiveness to set up containers - can change design later.
- Created unused views folder per convention for React, as well as hooks and tests
- Services folder consists of mock data fetching while we are not making any network requests yet
